This folder contains the scripts to replicate the analysis corresponding to the paper [Who Is That? Perceptual Expertise on Other-Race Face Comparisons, Disguised Face Comparisons, and Face Memory](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/s87na). The data in the paper was collected from forensic facial professionals (examiners and reviewers) and undergraduate students. Participants rated the similarity of faces and chose which faces they memorized. Student data can be obtained by contacting Prof. Alice J. O'Toole at The University of Texas at Dallas; forensic facial professional data can be obtained by contacting Dr. Amy N. Yates at NIST.

The file WhoIsThat.Rmd is the code used for figures and analysis in the paper, e.g., the Mann-Whitney tests and violin plots. The resultant output can be seen in the file WhoIsThat.html.

Code was completed using R version 4.3.0 and RStudio version 2023.06.0+421. For more information about R and RStudio, see https://www.r-project.org and https://www.rstudio.com.
